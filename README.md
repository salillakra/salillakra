# Hey, I'm Salil Lakra! 👋

Welcome Guys! 💻✨

## About Me 🦁

I'm a passionate tech enthusiast who loves to build stuff and break things (in a good way, of course). When I'm not coding, you might find me singing 🎤, hanging out 🛋️, or brainstorming my next big idea 💡. Wanna know more? Let's hang out and chat! 😉

## Projects 🔥

You can see my project at my GitHub repositories.  
Most of my projects are **work-in-progress**, thanks to my schedule ⏳. But if you're interested in contributing, feel free to check them out and send me a PR. I’d appreciate the help in getting these projects across the finish line! 💪

## Let's Connect! 🌐

Got coding questions 💻, or want to talk to me🙂? feel free to reach out to me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/officialsalillakra) or [Email me](mailto:salillakra.dev@gmail.com). Let's chat over coffee ☕ (or code! 🔥)

Feel free to check out my code and throw me a like 👍 (or a PR!). Happy coding! 😎✌️

Before you go, I've got something for you, a ❤️
